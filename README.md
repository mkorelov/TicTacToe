## TicTacToe

This is my implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using Java & JavaFX.

Features:
1. UI (Game Board, Tiles, Xs/Os, Title of Game, Player One/Two, Score, etc.)
2. Game Logic
2. Pause Menu (Restart, End Game)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
